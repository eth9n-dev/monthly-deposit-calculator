# Project Summary
In this project, we created a bank account simulation that would tell the user the amount of interest made based on monthly payments, interest rates, and a starting bank balance. This was the first assignment using headers and classes which allowed for a more organized project.

# What was done well?
Personally, I felt that the classes and headers were done well to keep clear and organized code. It allowed for easy readability from an outside standpoint so that others could understand the purpose of the code.

# What could be done better?
Most of the extra formatting and user input validation could've been done in methods to further clean up the main method.

# The most challenging part?
The most challenging part was implementing the newly learned material such as classes and headers. In order to overcome the challenge, I used some references from the textbook about headers and classes to set up my project. Overall, they were a very useful tool to keep clean and organized code.

# What skills have I gained?
The entire class material gave me new skills to use. These skills include writing clean code, commenting code, and modularizing code. C++ has since become and language that I want to pursue further after this course.

# How did I make this program maintainable, readable and adaptable?
In order to do all of the above, I used classes and header files. Using classes allow for the code in the main method to be clear and concise through its member functions. Anyone who wants to read or adapt the code wouldn't have a hard time due to the comments made about each function and its role in the program.
